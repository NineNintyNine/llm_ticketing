# Privacy Policy
_Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}_

We collect and process email data **only after you sign in and consent** via Microsoft/Google OAuth.  
We use read-only scopes (e.g., `Mail.Read` / `gmail.readonly`) to ingest support emails for triage and insights.

**What we collect**
- Email metadata (sender, subject, timestamps)  
- Message content and thread summaries  
- Derived data (classifications, embeddings, similar-case links)  
- Optional JIRA issue keys and statuses  

**How we use it**
- Summarize issues, suggest resolutions, estimate time-to-fix  
- Power search/retrieval of historical cases  
- Display dashboards (open/ongoing/resolved)  

**Data sharing**
- We do not sell your data. We may share data with processors strictly to provide the service (cloud hosting, logging).  

**Security**
- OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest.  
- We request `offline_access` only to refresh tokens securely.  
- Access is scoped to the signed-in user.  

**Your choices**
- Revoke access via Microsoft/Google account settings.  
- Request deletion by contacting: **your-email@example.com**
